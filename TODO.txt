[x] 1.Particle and Bounding box interactions
      a) Create a bounding box--
      b) Make visible boundries--
      c) Test using different and multiple particle positions and speeds
[x] 2. Particle - Particle interactions
[x] 3. Fluid mechanics:
[x]     Density
[x]     Viscosity
[x]     Make use of SPH model
    4. Testing fluid behaviour to different objects and containers
    5. Fluid interactions with user inputs
[x]  6. Add color gradients to make fluid presentable
    7. Final touches and bug testing and fixing
[x] 8. Upload to github and plan for future developments...
